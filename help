Hi Arjun,
My name is Juan Meza. I am contacting you because I need help with some of
the coins that got stuck in C-CEX. I will like to know the steps on how to
transfer these coins. I am not an expert with this kind of situation that
is why I will offer you 20% of my coins if you agree to help me. The goal
is to transfer the 98k coins that I have to Livecoins.net, I know you are
an expert so hopefully you can help me with this.

I had contacted C-CEX and they told me they are not responsible for this
situation.

Thank you so much for your time
